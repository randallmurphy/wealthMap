# Fullstack Web Application Assignment

## Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to develop a fullstack web application utilizing React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The project should incorporate authentication, JWT token-based authentication, input validation, CRUD operations, integration of 2-3 features, and integration of a 3rd Party API. Additionally, frequent commits to GitHub are required to track progress and facilitate collaboration. In this final, the application can be a rework or the application completed for the midterm, or a brand new application. If working on the past application, the proposal must include patch notes for the intended version and should introduce new features into the application. 

## Assignment Details:

### Requirements:
1. **Frontend Framework**: Utilize React for the frontend development. Must use newly learned hooks and therefore make frequent use of functional components.
2. **Backend Framework**: Use Node.js and Express for the backend development.
3. **Database**: Implement MongoDB for data storage.
4. **Authentication**: Implement authentication functionality for user registration and login.
5. **JWT Authentication**: Utilize JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for securing API endpoints and user sessions.
6. **Input Validation**: Implement input validation on both client and server sides to ensure data integrity.
7. **CRUD Operations**: Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing data.
8. **Features**: Integrate 2-3 additional features that enhance the functionality and user experience of the application.
9. **3rd Party API**: Integrate at least one external API to fetch or interact with data.
10. **GitHub Commits**: Maintain frequent commits to GitHub to track project progress and facilitate collaboration.

### Submission Requirements:
1. **Project Proposal**: Submit a project proposal outlining the planned features of the application, including the 3rd party API to be used. Additionally, include any additional technologies or techniques you plan to incorporate into the project that have not been covered in class.
2. **Project Implementation**: Develop the fullstack web application according to the proposed features and requirements outlined above. Ensure frequent commits to GitHub to track progress.
3. **Documentation**: Provide clear and concise documentation covering the setup, usage, and implementation details of the application.
4. **Source Code**: Submit the complete source code of the project along with any necessary dependencies.

## Evaluation Criteria:
- Adherence to Requirements
- Quality of Code
- User Interface and Experience
- Functionality and Features Implementation
- Integration of 3rd Party API
- Documentation Quality
- Frequency and Quality of GitHub Commits

## Submission Guidelines:
- The project proposal and all relevant materials should be submitted through the designated platform by the specified deadline.
- Frequent commits to GitHub are mandatory throughout the development process.
- Late submissions may incur penalties as per the course policy.
- Ensure that all submitted materials are well-organized and clearly labeled.

## Additional Notes:
- Students are encouraged to seek assistance from instructors or peers if they encounter any difficulties during the development process.
- Plagiarism or any form of academic dishonesty will result in severe penalties as per the academic integrity policy.
